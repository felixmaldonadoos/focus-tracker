# Background 

Current learning patterns rely on generalized methodologies, which recommend to take consistent breaks and compartmentalize active studying and breaks. 
Common include the Pomodoro technique (insert hyperlink) and Desktime study (insert hyperlink). These techniques recommend one to take 5 or 17 minute 
study breaks after 25 or 52 minutes of studying, Pomodoro and Desktime respectively. 

A challenge with this lacking personalized study methodologies. With digital distractions being introduced by remote work, common study patterns may not 
work effectively and apply to everyone, leading to anxiety buildup and burnout (SOURCE). The goal of our project is to develop a signal processing pipeline that allows the user to quantify times of 
active focus during their study time, to maximize learning and decrease stress and burnout. 

# focus-tracker
Implement electroencephalogram (EEG) to learn about personal learning habits and organize focus times to personalize and maximize learning.
